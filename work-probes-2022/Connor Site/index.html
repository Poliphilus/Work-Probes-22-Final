							<p>Hi my name is Connor, welcome to my personal website.
								I have had an obsession with technology from an early age,
								starting with nintendo color playing pokemon all the way to now where i will sit for hours playing World Of Warcraft.
								Iâ€™ve also been fascinated with how computers work, from the inside where I love building them to seeing how a web page loads!</p>

							<p>During the first COVID pandemic i started to learn how to code,
								i logged onto UDEMY and checked the first course that was no.1 FREE and also had python related courses,
								mainly because i had watched some videos on python before starting this journey.
								Once I started the course I had a fairly basic understanding of python. I made a basic question game,
								and I left Python alone and moved into HTML & CSS fundamentals.
								I started doing an Eduonix course, which was titled Full Stack.
								After 1 week i can honestly say i'm so happy i found Codecademy!!!
								It's so much easier to follow and actually includes real projects during every segment.</p>

							<p>From that point on i was hooked with Web Design, along with my love from Graphics Design from an early age, starting with creating youtube headers
                                on the old AMAZING style!! I've worked with some amazing people within Esports and Gaming and hopefully can further my career. Currently Head Designer
                                Team Orange Gaming!</p>

									mirror effect, edited in lightroom.
